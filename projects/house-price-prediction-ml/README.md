# House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using regression-based machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement
Given a set of features describing houses, the objective is to predict their market prices accurately.

## Workflow
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Feature selection and handling missing values
- Model training using regression algorithms
- Model evaluation
- Prediction generation

## Models Used
- Regression models (e.g. Linear Regression or similar)

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R² score.

## Outputs
- Prediction file generated for evaluation or submission
- Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes
This project demonstrates foundational machine learning concepts such as regression, feature handling, and evaluation.
