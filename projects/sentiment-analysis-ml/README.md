# Sentiment Analysis (NLP)

This project implements a sentiment analysis pipeline to classify text data into sentiment categories using classical Natural Language Processing techniques.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to analyze textual data and predict the sentiment expressed in each text sample using supervised machine learning.

## Workflow
- Data loading and inspection
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization)
- Feature extraction using vectorization techniques
- Model training and evaluation
- Generating predictions on unseen data

## Models Used
- Classical machine learning classifiers (e.g. Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes)

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.

## Outputs
- Trained model predictions saved as a CSV file
- Jupyter notebook documenting the full workflow

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes
This project focuses on demonstrating a complete NLP pipeline using interpretable and efficient classical methods.
